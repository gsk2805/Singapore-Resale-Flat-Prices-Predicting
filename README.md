- **Data Collection and Preprocessing:** Gather resale flat transaction data from the Singapore Housing and Development Board (HDB) and clean it for analysis.

- **Feature Engineering:** Extract and create relevant features such as town, flat type, storey range, floor area, flat model, and lease commence date.

- **Model Building:** Train machine learning models like linear regression, decision trees, and random forests on historical data.

- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate model performance using metrics like MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R¬≤ Score.

- **Web Application:** Develop a Streamlit app for users to input flat details and get predicted resale prices.

- **Deployment:** Deploy the Streamlit app on Render or any cloud platform.
   - Deploy the app on Render or any cloud platform.

## Deliverables
